**New Patterns**

Users are still starting to understand where GenAI fits into their personal and professional toolkits, and how to get the most out of these tools. Unlike most interfaces, GenAI creates unique outputs for each user. Instead of using traditional UI elements like buttons or filters, users have an undefined and infinitely variable way of getting these tools to accomplish a task.

We've seen in the development of conversational AI chatbots that users struggle to understand the ideal ways to prompt these systems to achieve desired results. More than ever before, users will need guidance on how to interact with generative technologies. By providing sample prompts and initiating dialogues with users, we can better understand what's possible and how to achieve the best results.

For example, instead of just presenting an empty input field, **Inflection's AI assistant Pi** greets users with a script: "Hey there, great to meet you. I'm Pi, your personal AI." My goal is to be useful, friendly, and fun. Ask me for advice, or let's talk about whatever's on your mind. How's your day going?

Traditional UI elements are also important in creating an ideal experience. Not all interactions work best via voice or text. For example, the **Kayak plug-in from ChatGPT** outputs a paragraph of top choices for flight options. Adjusting these options would be easier with a visual UI modal that enters the chat and uses traditional filters and sorting mechanisms.

As conversational AI matures, we're likely to see a mixture of familiar UI tools alongside new ones.

Furthermore, we're likely to see models integrate not just with traditional UIs but also with existing applications. Microsoft, Google, Salesforce, and others are already building GenAI capabilities into their suites of tools. It's most likely that enterprise software will use the same application, such as email and maps. Conversational AI chatbots will interact with these tools to create an integrated experience.

Multimodal inputs and outputs - text, voice, image, video code - will allow users to interact with new and existing applications in novel ways that require new UX thinking and patterns. Consider planning a vacation itinerary powered by a conversational AI integrated with rating sites and map applications. A simple request can create a list of top sites and restaurants to visit, along with suggested timing and routes all mapped out efficiently.

**Header Section:**
It be in Vienna from 7/14 to 7/17. Can you out together a daily itinerary for me with some attractions and restaurants while I'm there?

**Body Section:**

Of course, I'd be happy to help you plan a three-day itinerary for Vienna.

Since there's so much to see in this beautiful city, I'll focus on some of the key highlights that are relatively close together for a manageable walking tour. I've chosen some culturally and historically important places for you to visit, as well as all of the restaurants that are vegetarian-friendly. I've included maps of each location. Here's a suggested itinerary:

**7/14 Morning:**

*   **Hofburg Palace:** Start your day at the former principal imperial palace of the Habsburg dynasty that serves as the official residence and workplace of the President of Austria.
*   **Stephansdom:** Nearby is this iconic symbol of Vienna. It's one of the tallest churches in the world, but you decide to climb the 343 steps to the lower room.

**7/14 Afternoon:**

*   **Albertina Museum:** Start your afternoon at the Albertina Museum.
*   **Austrian National Library:** Next, visit the Austrian National Library.
*   **Belvedere Palace:** Finally, end your afternoon with a visit to the Belvedere Palace.

**7/14 Evening:**

*   **Cafe Sacher:** Have dinner at Cafe Sacher.
*   **Vienna State Opera House:** After dinner, catch a show at the Vienna State Opera House.
*   **Punsch Restaurant:** Finish off your evening with dessert and drinks at Punsch Restaurant.

Please note that availability may vary, and it's always a good idea to book reservations in advance. Let me know if you would like me to make arrangements for you.

**Infinite Possibilities**

The magic and challenge of GenAI is that it produces a different outcome for each user. While this allows for amazing new possibilities for personalization, it also means giving up a certain amount of control. Traditional ways of testing products with users will have to be supplemented with new thinking around how products function differently for each user.

One aspect of this challenge is that companies creating experiences for present users with the desired voice, tone, and content will not produce inappropriate responses or create experiences that feel right for a given brand. The former is subject to complex debates around censorship, representation, and accuracy. One leading company creating a foundational LLM, Anthropic, is pushing "constitutional" AI - attempting to align around a set of universal values and automate the creation of "harmless" AI. Whether or not this becomes a standard, specific products will be needed to allow companies to fine-tune their outputs to create on-brand experiences they want to deliver to customers.

Going beyond avoiding risks, designing the right brand experience presents an opportunity for deep personalization as we have never seen before. GenAI can push beyond existing capabilities such as product recommendations and craft specific contexts and stories to match the value of the right product with the needs of a given customer. For example, a conversational AI chatbot can tell a customer why a product makes sense for them and even build additional products or extensions in real-time. However, models rarely produce flawless executions of these kinds of experiences on their own. To get these interactions right, traditional product development methodologies such as mapping out customer journeys, rapid prototyping, and ongoing user testing will be essential. With unique outputs for each user, data collection through feedback mechanisms such as thumbs up and down responses on ChatGPT can help continuously tune and improve models.

A stumbling block for many LLMs has been "hallucinations" or generated content that is nonsensical or factually incorrect in how it uses source content. At least now in the development of GenAI, users cannot be sure if they can always trust a model's outputs. As users utilize LLMs for a mix of generating creative outputs as well as searching for factual and accurate content, designers will need to build in citations and pathways back to source content to build trust. Creative design solutions will be needed to find innovative ways to preview, pin, and store embedded source documents without sending users away from the conversational AI interface and reduce the need to scroll endlessly through conversation histories retracing steps.

Rapid Change

Writing about patterns in GenAI is almost comically difficult as the newness of the field and the rapid pace of change render many conclusions moot within weeks if not days. However, the potential of this technology requires us to make an effort to codify some principles even as the ground constantly shifts beneath us. Anyone moving to tap into the potential of GenAI in these early days by building products and services will have to be nimble and remain highly aware of the changing landscape.

An area likely to see significant change going forward is in the types of generative content that models produce and the types of new interfaces needed to navigate these outputs. Early generative art models take a single text field and output an image. We are now seeing models such as DragGAN that allow users to stretch and bend photos in all directions, for example, to dynamically change the direction an animal is facing in an image or increase the height of trees on the horizon. These types of real-time adjustments to outputs will grow in sophistication and expand to new modalities.

Designing interfaces for the equivalent in video is still a step away but we can imagine a more interesting task to enable elaborate world-building for video games and movies, and the possibility of building generative molecules as complex specialized use cases emerge.

Basic agent-based models are already available with plug-ins from ChatGPT and experiments built on technologies such as LangChain. While many of these models are currently unreliable or limited to small sets of use cases, at some point soon we will see GenAI building entire interfaces and applications in real time for users. The next challenge will be visualizing these agent pathways by surfacing a view of the application programming interfaces (APIs) they use to accomplish tasks and finding ways for users to adjust those actions, enabling them to have control over and confidence in the output created by GenAI.

**No time to wait**

The changes we outline here are only a few examples of where this technology is heading. Remember just six months ago, most of the world had never even heard of GenAI. Never have we seen a digital technology that evolves so quickly and in so many directions. Building products that will integrate GenAI models will require a level of flexible design we haven't seen before. While the field has much maturation still to undergo, waiting for this to happen may be too late. The advantage of GenAI would likely come at too great a cost, with so many players looking to capitalize on it. Yet, at the same time, looking now to map out overly distant road maps for it would be equally risky, given the likelihood of further exponential advancements in the technology. Anyone looking to harness the potential of GenAI will need to move quickly, build iteratively, and pivot often.
